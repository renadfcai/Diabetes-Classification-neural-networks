# Diabetes-Classification

# Run

To run the project run the application.py file

# Project Summary

The goal of this project is to develop a classification model for diabetes prediction. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze a dataset of patients' health information and determine the likelihood of an individual having diabetes.

## Dataset Analysis

The dataset contains essential features such as glucose rate, weight, age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and gender. In-depth analysis of the dataset reveals interesting insights related to diabetes and its risk factors.

## Model Development

Several classification models were explored.

## Web Application

To provide an interactive user experience, a web application was developed using Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap. The application allows users to input their health information and obtain a prediction regarding the presence or absence of diabetes based on the selected classification model.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the significance of classification models in diabetes prediction.
